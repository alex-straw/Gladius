# Gladius
Tax calculator for Coinbase Pro and Coinbase trading data.  HMRC jurisdiction.

Originally this was developed for a startup named 'Gladius Crypto Tax'

As pricing structures for other SAAS firms took on the freemium model, the business model for Gladius has been made redundant, and consequently the start-up cancelled.

Uses historical data from Binance minute data to calculate capital gains and losses.

Takes as input:
  - Transaction history .csv data generated by Coinbase / Coinbase Pro
  - Tax Year

Outputs (MVP):
  -  Capital gains (£) / losses (£) in the respective tax year
